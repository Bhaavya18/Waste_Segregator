# Waste Segregator
  * Waste Segregation is an important part of proper waste disposal.
  * Waste segregation at source can reduce up to 250 tonnes of dump from entering into landfills.
  * Our Twilio WhatsApp Bot makes it easier for a user to segregate their waste.
  * To know the type of waste user can either upload an image or enter the name of the item manually.
  * Our ML model will classify the waste into Organic, Recyclable or Non-Recyclable waste.
